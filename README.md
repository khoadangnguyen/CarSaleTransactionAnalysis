# Car Sale Transaction Analysis
Analyze car sale transaction data to come up with training data and test data for Regression model

This project is to analyze the provided car sale transaction from 96 car makes, 972 models, and 1963 trims from 1982 
to 2015 to come up with what car make, model, trim, and year can be used for training data and test data for the
Regression model to predict car sale price

The analysis results in some popular car make, model, and trim having continuous car sale transaction from 2001 to 2015
(15 years). Two of these are the Toyota Camry (LE, SE, and XLE) and Honda Odyssey (EX, EX-L, and Touring), and the 
results are plotted with Matplotlib as below.
